# Batcave

**A fancy name for my homelab.**

Don't take this repo *too* seriously - it's just a homelab sandbox for playing with different open-source software and learning new things.

### [ansible](./ansible)

Inventory and playbooks for my Raspberry Pis.

### [docker](./docker)

Docker compose files for most of the software I currently self-host.

### [terraform](./terraform)

Basic terraform config for creating resources where necessary, such as this repository.
